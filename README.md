# APCS2 Final Project
## Group Info
Group Members: Nelson Chan, Jonathan Metzler
Group Name: Code The Rope
## Overview
Emulation of the game Cut the Rope with basic features implemented. Candy is an object whose if moved to the green monster OmNom results in a victory. The score can be boosted by collecting stars. Ropes are attached to the candy and can be cut to maneuver the candy. If a candy hits a bubble it reverses gravity until it is popped. Connectors form new ropes when the candy enters its proximity. The player loses if the candy hits a spike or goes off-screen and can never return. Players choose 6 levels. Levels 1 - 5 each display a new feature.
## Instructions
Our game is solely mouse-based. On Menu select level by clicking on it. To cut a rope click once on one side and once on the other. A line segment should appear between the clicks. To pop a bubble click on in. The top right has a pause icon that pulls up the pause menu when pressed. The leftmost pause menu icon is to restart the level, the center icon is to return to the level selection menu, and the rightmost icon is to resume the level.
No libraries need to be imported.

## Bugs
